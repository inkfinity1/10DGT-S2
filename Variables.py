# Different types of variables
# Store a number
num_1 = 80 # assigning 80 to num_1
print(num_1) # This displays what num_1 contains

# Store a string
name = "Juergen"
print(name)
name = "jwe bjkf.hkfebk" # reassinging value to an existing varible]
print (name) 
 
 # Do calculations in a variable and store the result
sum=5+5 # Do good practice
sum = 5 + 5 # follows PEP8 Pytjon conventions
print(sum)
sum = "5 + 5 = 10" # this is a string
print(sum)

# Adding strings together is called  concatenation
concatenation = name + sum
print(concatenation)
